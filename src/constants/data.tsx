const ABOUT_ME = `I'm a software engineer based in Istanbul, Turkey and also a master student in engineering management. I enjoy creating things that live on the internet, whether that be websites, applications, or anything in between. I have been working for 2 years now and beside that I worked 1 year while studying at the university. I've manage to gain a decent amount of experience and valuable knowledge from all different kinds of fields throughout my projects/work. Additionally, I was going to go to the USA with the Work and Travel program but even though I passed all the interviews and got the USA visa, I couldn't go because of the coronavirus pandemic.`;
